Depoloyed on Vercel: https://nominis.vercel.app/

### Assumptions made

- I've used Chakra UI as CSS framework, it could be done with others options (Material UI, Bootstrap, even Vainilla CSS) but i preferred to work with a framework that i know for time reasons.

- I`ve used the useMediaQuery hook to the responsivness, again, it could be done in many ways but i preferred to have two views as in the interview was mention that next steps could be in React Native, and exclusive view will help on that.

- As was no mentions to logics on the lifes or the sound button i keep the same images that was sent, no logics to handle clicks. The sound button color is no correct in the mobile view for that reason.

### Dependencies

- Chakra UI (and recommended dependencies)

### Test

- I have no experience in test, i preferred not to make just a "component render" test with jest.
